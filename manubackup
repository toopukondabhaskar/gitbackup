Getting Started with Config Reuse
Add your project on the Add Projects page if it is a new project. For an existing Project, go to the Project Settings and enable Build Processing with the radio button.

(Optional) Install the CircleCI-Public CLI by following the Using the CircleCI CLI documentation. The circleci config process command is helpful for checking reusable config.

Change the version key to 2.1 in your .circleci/config.yml file and commit the changes to test your build. Ensure that your project build succeeds with the new processing before adding any new 2.1 keys to your config.

Run builds with your new configuration by pushing to your GitHub or Bitbucket repo that has been added in a project in CircleCI. The Jobs page displays runs using the new processing service.

After your build is running successfully with build processing enabled and version 2.1 in the .circleci/config.yml file, it is possible to add new keys to reuse config and run the same job more than once with different parameters (re-use jobs).
